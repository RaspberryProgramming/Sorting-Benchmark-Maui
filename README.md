# Sorting Benchmark Maui

Maui Blazor Application for benchmarking sorting algorithms. Currently the following algorithms are used:
 - Radix Sort
 - Bubble Sort
 - Bucket Sort
 
You can see the time it takes for each algorithm and modify how many elements it will sort. The array is initially created with random values at start.
